As a Software Engineer, I have had the opportunity to work on applications and systems that have reached a wide user base, such as Airlift Express. My experience includes developing highly scalable Microservice-based Backend Systems and an iOS Application that caters to a considerable number of daily users with a significant number of downloads. I have also gained valuable expertise in implementing MVVM and Clean Architecture principles in my work. Additionally, I have had the privilege of contributing to the conversion of a Monolithic Application into multiple Microservices and handling backends that efficiently processed numerous requests per second.
