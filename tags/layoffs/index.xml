He asked me to cancel all the orders except the Eid ones. I thought that maybe we got more orders than we were expecting. Right after that call, I got another call from our Platform Integrity Lead, he told me that the Eid orders were not landing on the warehouses and shared a video call link to join.</description></item></channel></rss>
